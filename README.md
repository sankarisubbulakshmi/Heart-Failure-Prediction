# Heart Disease Prediction Dataset
## Overview
This dataset contains medical records of patients related to heart disease diagnosis. 
It includes various health metrics that can be used to predict the presence of heart disease. 
This dataset is suitable for supervised learning tasks.

## Dataset Description
The dataset consists of several records with 12 columns, each representing different attributes related to the health status of the patients:

## columns and their details

1. Age: Age of the patient (years).
2. Sex: Gender of the patient (M: Male, F: Female).
3. ChestPainType: Type of chest pain (ATA: Atypical Angina, NAP: Non-Anginal Pain, ASY: Asymptomatic, TA: Typical Angina).
4. RestingBP: Resting blood pressure (mm Hg).
5. Cholesterol: Serum cholesterol in mg/dL.
6. FastingBS: Fasting blood sugar (1 if FastingBS > 120 mg/dL, 0 otherwise).
7. RestingECG: Resting electrocardiographic results (Normal, ST, LVH).
8. MaxHR: Maximum heart rate achieved.
9. ExerciseAngina: Exercise-induced angina (Y: Yes, N: No).
10. Oldpeak: ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest.
11. ST_Slope: The slope of the peak exercise ST segment (Up, Flat, Down).
12. HeartDisease: Diagnosis of heart disease (1: Yes, 0: No) - target column.
## Learning Outcomes
